Fingerprinting of materials based on their electronic structure.

Python package to compute fingerprints of the electronic density-of-states (DOS) and evaluate the similarity of materials based on their electronic structures.

This package implements the DOS fingerprints and the similarity metrics introduced in Refs. [1,2]. 

Our DOS fingerprints can be tailored to target specific ranges of the energy spectrum. The computed fingerprints allow for the evaluation of the similarity of the electronic structure.

As a similarity measure we use the Tanimoto coefficient [3].

# Usage

Fingerprints are instances of the `DOSFingerprint()` class and can be calculated by providing the energy in [Joule] and the DOS in [states/unit cell/Joule] to the `calculate()` method. Furthermore, the energy axis can be discretized over a non-uniform grid. For this, specific parameters must be provided. By default, the grid is specialized on the energy range between -10 and 5 eV, thereby emphasizing the upper valence region.

```Python
from nomad_dos_fingerprints import DOSFingerprint
dos_fingerprint = DOSFingerprint().calculate(<dos_energies>,<dos_values>)
```

To evaluate the similarity, the function `tanimoto_similarity()` can be used:

```Python
from nomad_dos_fingerprints import tanimoto_similarity
tc = tanimoto_similarity(dos_fingerprint_1, dos_fingerprint_2)
```
